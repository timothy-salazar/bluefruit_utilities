# Adafruit Bluefruit UART Utilities

Recently I bought an Adafruit Bluefruit UART module for a personal project. I wanted to work with it using a Raspberry Pi, so I'm in the process of writing a few tools. 

### uart_com.py

This is a little script that uses the [pigpio library](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) to communicate with the Bluefruit Friend.
